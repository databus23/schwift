Package schwift is a client library for OpenStack Swift
(https://github.com/openstack/swift, https://openstack.org).

It uses Gophercloud (https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud) for
authentication, so you usually start by obtaining a gophercloud.ServiceClient
for Swift like so:

	authOptions, err := openstack.AuthOptionsFromEnv() // or build a gophercloud.AuthOptions instance yourself
	provider, err := openstack.AuthenticatedClient(authOptions)
	client, err := openstack.NewObjectStorageV1(provider, gophercloud.EndpointOpts{})

Or, if you use Swift's built-in authentication instead of Keystone:

	provider, err := openstack.NewClient("http://swift.example.com:8080")
	client, err := swauth.NewObjectStorageV1(provider, swauth.AuthOpts {
		User: "project:user",
		Key:  "password",
	})

Then, in both cases, you use schwift.AccountFromGophercloud() to obtain a
schwift.Account instance, from which point you have access to all of schwift's
API.

Caching

When a GET or HEAD request is sent by an Account, Container or Object instance,
the headers associated with that thing will be stored in that instance and not
retrieved again.

	obj := account.Container("foo").Object("bar")

	hdr, err := obj.Headers() //sends HTTP request "HEAD <storage-url>/foo/bar"
	...
	hdr, err = obj.Headers()  //returns cached values immediately

If this behavior is not desired, the Invalidate() method can be used to clear
caches on any Account, Container or Object instance.
